To set up our project:
- Install Node 21.6.1 with npm 10.4.0 ([Node JS Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current))
- Create a template project with the command `npm create-react-app app`
- Move into the app directory: `cd app`
- Run the app locally using `npm start`
- We connected our react app to AWS services through ([Amplify React App](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/module-two/?e=gs2020&p=build-a-react-app-one))
